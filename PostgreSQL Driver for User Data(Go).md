# PostgreSQL Driver for Go

This driver provides a convenient way to interact with a PostgreSQL database in Go. It includes methods to retrieve user data from a specific table and convert it to a JSON string format.

## Development Environment

To set up the development environment for using the PostgreSQL driver in Go, follow these steps:

1. Install Go: Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official Go website: https://golang.org/dl/

2. Install PostgreSQL: Install PostgreSQL on your machine. You can download it from the official PostgreSQL website: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

3. Install the PostgreSQL driver package: Run the following command in your terminal to install the PostgreSQL driver package:
    ```
    go get github.com/lib/pq
    ```

## Usage

1. Import the required packages in your Go file:
    ```go
    import (
        "database/sql"
        "fmt"
    
        "github.com/lib/pq"
        "github.com/your-username/your-project-name/pgdriver"
    )
    ```

2. Connect to the PostgreSQL database:
    ```go
    db, err := sql.Open("postgres", "user=your_user password=your_password dbname=your_db sslmode=disable")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    defer db.Close()
    ```

3. Create a new instance of the UserTable:
    ```go
    userTable := pgdriver.NewUserTable(db)
    ```

4. Retrieve users from the user table:
    ```go
    users, err := userTable.GetUsers()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    for _, user := range users {
        fmt.Printf("User: %v\n", user)
    }
    ```

5. Retrieve users in JSON format:
    ```go
    jsonData, err := userTable.GetUsersJSON()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }

    fmt.Println(string(jsonData))
    ```

Make sure to replace `"github.com/your-username/your-project-name/pgdriver"` with the correct import path based on your project's structure.

Remember to replace the database connection details (`user=your_user`, `password=your_password`, `dbname=your_db`) with your actual PostgreSQL database credentials.
