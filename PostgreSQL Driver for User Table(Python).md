# User Table Driver

This driver script connects to a PostgreSQL database, retrieves data from the `public.user_table`, and converts it to a JSON string using the `psycopg2` library in Python.

## Development Environment

To use the User Table Driver, you need the following:

- Python 3.6 or above
- `psycopg2` library

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
     pip install psycopg2


2. Ensure you have a PostgreSQL server up and running with the following details:
- Hostname or IP address of the server
- Database name
- Username and password with appropriate privileges to access the database

3. Update the connection details in the `user_table_driver.py` file:
- Replace `"your_host"` with the hostname or IP address of your PostgreSQL server.
- Replace `"your_database"` with the name of your PostgreSQL database.
- Replace `"your_username"` with your PostgreSQL username.
- Replace `"your_password"` with your PostgreSQL password.

## Usage

1. Save the `user_table_driver.py` file to your local directory.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `user_table_driver.py` file.

3. Run the following command to execute the driver script:
     python user_table_driver.py


The script will connect to the PostgreSQL database, retrieve the data from the `public.user_table`, convert it to a JSON string, and print the JSON string to the console.

4. Customize the driver script as needed to incorporate the retrieved JSON data into your application.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any errors related to the `psycopg2` library, make sure it is installed correctly by running `pip install psycopg2` or consult the library's documentation for troubleshooting tips.

- If you face issues connecting to the PostgreSQL database, ensure that the connection details provided in the `user_table_driver.py` file are accurate and that the database server is accessible from your environment.
