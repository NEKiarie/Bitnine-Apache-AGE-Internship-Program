# PostgreSQL Driver for User Table

This driver file allows you to retrieve data from a PostgreSQL database table named "user_table" and return the results in JSON format. It uses the psycopg2 library to interact with the database.

## Development Environment

- Python version: 3.x
- Required libraries: psycopg2

## Setup

1. Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, you can download and install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install psycopg2: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the psycopg2 library:


3. Update connection details: Open the `postgres_driver.py` file and replace the placeholders in the `conn` variable with the appropriate connection details for your PostgreSQL database.

## Usage

1. Run the driver file: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `postgres_driver.py` file, and execute the following command:


This will connect to the PostgreSQL database, retrieve the data from the "user_table" table, and print the results in JSON format.

Note: Make sure you have the required permissions to access the database and table.

2. Interpret the JSON output: The driver file will print a JSON string representing the data from the "user_table" table. You can use this JSON string in your Python code or any other application to process the data further.
